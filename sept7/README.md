There were a some difficulties while doing the code, that I've listed below

- I had to be very repetitive while coding. The same colors and the same shapes required to be called a number of times.
- I wanted to have abstract shapes in my portrait, which I couldn't achieve - shapes with curves that aren't arcs. In short, the portrait couldn't be like free-form hand drawn art.
- It took time and multiple trial and errors to locate where I wanted to put each shape.
