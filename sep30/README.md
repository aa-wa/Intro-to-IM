# Bar Graph showing the Increase in Deaths by COVID in the US from March 1-7, 2021

## Concept

The idea is pretty clear from the topic. This is a simple bar diagram showing the increase in deaths by COVID in the US from March 1-7, 2021. It's just a data visualization i did from a random source I found in the internet. It's from covidtracking.com/data.

## Application

The file I downloaded had tons of data including the deaths, the death rates, the death increases etc. I particularly chose the increased number of deaths because it had smaller numbers, ones which I could easily utilize in processing. I created an array to store the csv data, and an array to stor each row so that I could access specific columns from the row. I accessed the columns with the increase in deaths and created rectangles such that their width corresponded to these numbers. March 1st was recorded at the bottom, and March 7th was recorded at the top as the date gradually increased from the bottom to the top. 

## Issues

I wanted to make each bar grow out from zero to its width, but couldn't accomplish this. I tried multiple methods but couldn't get a conclusion. I'd be happy if I get any feedback regarding this :)
