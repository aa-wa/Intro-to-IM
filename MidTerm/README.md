# Modified Tic-Tac-Toe!!

## Concept

The concept behind the game was very simple. It was meant to be the classic tic-tac-toe game with a twist i.e. with tic-tacs and toes instead of circles and crosses.  

## Application

I started by making a box class and making a board array of the box objects. The board was just a simple 3/3 grid of rectangles. The Box objects, depending upon whether the user clicks on them or not and which user clicks on them if they do, can be either empty, or filled with an illustration of a tic-tac or that of a toe. I sketched the illustrations myself using blender.
