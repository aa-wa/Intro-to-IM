# FINGER SWITCH

## Concept

The concept behind the project is really simple. I've created a circuit for which my fingers act as the switch. The circuit closes when the index fingers of both my hands join, it opens when they're not attached.

## Application

I took a simple circuit consisting of an LED, a 330 Ohm resistor and some wires. Using some tape, I attached a wire connected to the positive of the LED to a piece of aluminium foil and attached the foil to the index finger of my left hand. Similarly, I took a wire off PIN 2 of the Arduino and attached that to another piece of  aluminium foil and attached that to the index finger of my right hand. The negative of the LED was connected to a 330 Ohm resistor, which was then connected to the ground. As such, the circuit was closed when my fingers were joined together as the aluminium pieces conducted electricity.

## Issues

No issues arised during the project.
